## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Vanilla Javascroipt

### What I learned

I'm ready to try a framework. The laborious process of working with the DOM in vanilla javascript is starting to wear on me. Not being able to smoothly break the project into components makes it difficult to manage.

### Continued development

I'm going to build my next site with Astro.js
